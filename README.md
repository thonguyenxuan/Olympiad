# Olympiad
This is an on going notes on high school mathematical olympiad. I created most problems in chapter 1, and some problems in chapter 2. 
The rest of the problems are from Putnam exams, USA, and other national mathematical competitions. I just wrote problems in fun time.
The mateiral contains a lot of typos but if you actually work out the problems, you will get the right solutions.
